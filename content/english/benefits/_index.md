In the 2013-2015 collective agreement settled in October 2015 , the following two benefit improvements were achieved:

- Prescription glasses increased to $750;
- Dental implants increased to 75% coverage.


Additionally, the CUPE Retireesâ€™ Association has been working with the parties to protect the current benefit for out-of-town medical appointments. Green Shield had denied the claim which it had been accepting for years, and planned to restrict the use of personal vehicles for such appointments, which had a profound impact on rural retirees. CUPE has now agreed that personal vehicles may be used when no public transportation is available.
