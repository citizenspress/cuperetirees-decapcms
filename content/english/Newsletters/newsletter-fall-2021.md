SUBJECT: CUPE National Convention and other news from your retirees association

Dear Sisters and Brothers,

The CUPE National Convention, November 23-26, has been moved to a virtual platform. You should have already received via email an invitation from the National Officers to attend as an observer. If you wish to receive a link to observe online, you must send a personal email address to Johanne Danis ([jdanis@cupe.ca](mailto:jdanis@cupe.ca)) by November 17.

The combination of time constraints and the lack of a stage for in-person greetings means that the traditional recognition of retirees will not be on the agenda for this convention. We have asked whether eligible new retirees will be invited at CUPE’s expense to the next in-person convention and were reminded that this is an invitation extended at the discretion of the National Officers and not an obligation. Follow-up will be necessary as we approach the 2023 convention.

**CSRA EXECUTIVE BOARD CHANGE**

With a move to British Columbia, CSRA Alberta Chapter Rep Daunine Rauchert has stepped down. Thank you Daunine for your time and effort to remain in touch with Alberta retirees and keep the rest of the Executive Board informed. In accordance with our by-laws, the Executive Committee has appointed Judy Barry to the position for the rest of term, which ends December 31, 2022. You can reach her at [daleandjudybarry@gmail.com](mailto:daleandjudybarry@gmail.com) or 780-444-7775. Welcome, Judy!

**CONGRATULATIONS, BARRY!**

CSRA Treasurer Barry Thorsteinson was acclaimed 3rd Vice-President of the National Pensioners Federation at their recent virtual convention. The convention ran over three days, for just 2.5 hours each day, and included several speakers. Long-term care and the dire housing situation in much of the country remain top of mind issues. We will endeavour to keep you informed of NPF campaigns through emails like this and Facebook.

In solidarity,

Pat, Shelly, Barry and Carole
