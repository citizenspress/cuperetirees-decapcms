## CRA Newsletter March 2020

Dear CUPE Retiree,

With winter travel underway and school breaks in many parts of the country, we want to ensure that you have received the latest information from Green Shield Canada related to the coronavirus (COVID-19). While many of you have received this information directly, we have found that many others are not receiving communiqués from Green Shield.

Please note the information on early refills of prescriptions in particular. We recommend registering online at [www.greenshield.ca](http://www.greenshield.ca) if you have not already done so and checking the box that says you want to receive offers and news from Green Shield. If you are registered, you can find the box under Authorizations on your account page.

If you're on Facebook, remember to join the CUPE Retirees page.

In solidarity,

CUPE Retirees' Association

Pat Daley, President

Shelly Gordon, Vice-President

Barry Thorsteinson, Treasurer

Carole Lefebvre, Secretary

**GSC Update: The latest info on the coronavirus and travel implications**

With the ongoing global impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19), Green Shield Canada (GSC) is actively assessing the situation – in collaboration with our travel partner, Allianz Global Assistance (GSC Travel Assistance) – and we are taking this opportunity to share responses to the questions we are hearing most often.

**Where can I access the latest travel updates specific to the coronavirus?**

First and foremost, we strongly encourage you to review the travel guidance from the Public Health Agency of Canada. In terms of GSC-specific information, the latest updates can be found via the GSC Support Centre ([www.greenshield.ca](http://www.greenshield.ca)). While we will provide further email communications in the event of significant developments, we recommend getting familiar with our Support Centre for the very latest clarifications.

**What does it mean for my coverage if I travel to an area which is not under a travel advisory at the time of departure and then the status changes while I’m at the destination?**

If your travel coverage will expire while stranded in an area under quarantine (due to the trip day limit or a limited coverage period), GSC will extend the emergency medical coverage until the end of the period of quarantine. If you are stranded beyond the planned return date from your trip in an area under quarantine, GSC will allow reimbursement for meals and accommodations for the additional unplanned days up to the amount included in your benefits plan.

**What does it mean for my coverage if I travel to an area after a travel advisory has been issued by the Government of Canada?**

Any medical claims related to condition(s) for which the advisory was issued will not be eligible. Extensions to travel coverage beyond the maximum number of days will not be considered if you are stranded in a location due to quarantine.

**What should I do if I experience coronavirus symptoms ahead of upcoming travel?**

As with all pre-existing medical conditions, you may not be covered for medical treatment if you experience symptoms prior to travelling. Please refer to your benefit booklet for more details on preexisting conditions/being “stable” to travel.

**What should I do if I experience coronavirus symptoms while travelling?**

Contact GSC Travel Assistance as soon as the symptoms arise. You can find the phone number on the back of your ID card (as well as on your electronic ID on GSC’s mobile app).

**Is there anything else I should do before travelling?**

If you are travelling outside of Canada, we strongly recommend that you register for Global Affairs as another source of timely information.

**Can I request an early refill or additional days’ supply of my prescription medication as a result of the coronavirus?**

No. All policies and guidelines will remain unchanged at this time. Your medication can be refilled once you are 80 per cent of the way through your days’ supply. Prescriptions filled early, or in excess of the allowed quantity, will not be reimbursed through your benefits plan. Rest assured that we are monitoring the situation on a daily basis and will communicate updates as needed.

**Does GSC have a Business Continuity Plan in place for emergency situations?**

Yes. GSC has rigorous, interrelated Business Continuity, Emergency Management and Infectious Disease (inclusive of pandemic scenarios) programs in place. These programs enable our teams to plan, respond and recover from a wide variety of incidents, and are also designed to review and mitigate risks. They focus on ensuring the security and protection of our people, facilities and critical business functions as well as maintaining continuity of operations for our plan sponsors. GSC’s policies and plans are developed to meet or exceed the requirements of international standards and industry best practices.
